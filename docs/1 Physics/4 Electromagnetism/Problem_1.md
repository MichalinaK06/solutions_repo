# Problem 1

Let’s tackle **Option 1: Simplified Task – Algorithm Description**. I’ll describe an algorithm for calculating equivalent resistance using graph theory, provide pseudocode, and explain how it works with clear examples, including nested combinations. Then, I’ll briefly analyze its efficiency and suggest improvements.

### Algorithm Description: Equivalent Resistance via Graph Theory

The core idea is to model an electrical circuit as an undirected weighted graph:
- **Nodes** represent junctions or terminals in the circuit.
- **Edges** represent resistors, with weights equal to their resistance values (in ohms).
- The goal is to compute the equivalent resistance between two specified nodes (e.g., the input and output terminals) by iteratively simplifying the graph.

The algorithm simplifies the graph by identifying and reducing **series** and **parallel** connections until only the two target nodes remain, connected by a single edge whose weight is the equivalent resistance. Here’s how it works:

1. **Series Reduction**: If two nodes are connected by a single path (a chain of resistors with intermediate nodes of degree 2), replace the chain with a single edge whose weight is the sum of the resistances.
2. **Parallel Reduction**: If two nodes are connected by multiple edges (resistors in parallel), replace them with a single edge whose weight is computed using the parallel resistance formula: \( \frac{1}{R_{eq}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \cdots \).
3. **Iterative Process**: Repeatedly apply series and parallel reductions until the graph is reduced to a single edge between the start and end nodes.

For nested or complex configurations, the algorithm uses graph traversal techniques (like DFS) to detect these patterns systematically.

### Pseudocode

```plaintext
Function CalculateEquivalentResistance(Graph G, Node start, Node end):
    Input: Graph G (nodes, edges with weights), start node, end node
    Output: Equivalent resistance between start and end

    While G has more than 2 nodes OR more than 1 edge between start and end:
        // Step 1: Detect and reduce series connections
        For each node N in G:
            If degree(N) == 2 AND N != start AND N != end:
                Neighbors = {A, B} // N connected to A and B
                R1 = weight(A, N)
                R2 = weight(N, B)
                Remove node N and edges (A, N), (N, B)
                Add edge (A, B) with weight R1 + R2

        // Step 2: Detect and reduce parallel connections
        For each pair of nodes (U, V) in G:
            If multiple edges exist between U and V:
                R_parallel = 0
                For each edge E between U and V:
                    R_parallel = R_parallel + (1 / weight(E))
                R_eq = 1 / R_parallel
                Remove all edges between U and V
                Add edge (U, V) with weight R_eq

        // Step 3: Check termination
        If no reductions applied AND G not fully reduced:
            Print "Graph may require advanced methods (e.g., Delta-Wye)"
            Break

    Return weight of edge between start and end
```

### Explanation and Examples

#### How It Handles Nested Combinations
The algorithm iteratively simplifies the graph, handling nested series and parallel connections by reducing them layer by layer. Let’s walk through three examples:

1. **Simple Series Combination**
   - Graph: `A --2Ω--> B --3Ω--> C`
   - Start = A, End = C
   - Step 1: Node B has degree 2. Remove B, combine edges A-B (2Ω) and B-C (3Ω).
   - New Graph: `A --5Ω--> C`
   - Result: 5Ω

2. **Simple Parallel Combination**
   - Graph: `A --2Ω--> B`, `A --3Ω--> B` (two edges between A and B)
   - Start = A, End = B
   - Step 1: Detect parallel edges. Compute \( \frac{1}{R_{eq}} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{3}{6} + \frac{2}{6} = \frac{5}{6} \), so \( R_{eq} = \frac{6}{5} = 1.2Ω \).
   - New Graph: `A --1.2Ω--> B`
   - Result: 1.2Ω

3. **Nested Configuration (Series with Parallel)**
   - Graph: `A --1Ω--> B --2Ω--> C`, `B --3Ω--> C` (B to C has 2Ω and 3Ω in parallel)
   - Start = A, End = C
   - Step 1: Reduce parallel edges B-C. \( \frac{1}{R_{eq}} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{5}{6} \), so \( R_{eq} = 1.2Ω \).
   - New Graph: `A --1Ω--> B --1.2Ω--> C`
   - Step 2: Node B has degree 2. Reduce series A-B (1Ω) and B-C (1.2Ω). \( R_{eq} = 1 + 1.2 = 2.2Ω \).
   - New Graph: `A --2.2Ω--> C`
   - Result: 2.2Ω

For **complex graphs with cycles** (e.g., bridges or Wheatstone-like circuits), this basic algorithm may stall if no series or parallel reductions apply. In such cases, advanced techniques like **Delta-Wye transformation** or **Kirchhoff’s laws** with matrix methods (e.g., Laplacian matrix) are needed, but I’ll keep it simple here as per Option 1.

### Efficiency Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: Depends on the number of nodes (\(n\)) and edges (\(m\)).
  - Series reduction: \(O(n)\) per iteration to check degrees and update edges.
  - Parallel reduction: \(O(m)\) to scan for multiple edges.
  - Total: \(O(n \cdot (n + m))\) in the worst case, assuming \(n\) iterations.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n + m)\) to store the graph.

**Limitations**: The algorithm assumes the circuit can be fully reduced via series and parallel rules, which fails for non-planar or bridge circuits (e.g., Wheatstone bridge).

**Potential Improvements**:
1. **Cycle Detection**: Use DFS or BFS to identify bridges and cycles, enabling Delta-Wye transformations.
2. **Matrix Methods**: Implement a Laplacian matrix approach for a more general solution, though it’s computationally heavier (\(O(n^3)\)).
3. **Optimization**: Prioritize reductions by maintaining a queue of reducible nodes/edges, reducing redundant scans.

This approach provides a clear, algorithmic way to compute equivalent resistance using graph theory, balancing simplicity and insight. For a full implementation (Option 2), tools like Python’s `networkx` could turn this pseudocode into executable code—let me know if you’d like that next!
