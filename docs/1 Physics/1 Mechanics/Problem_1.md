# Problem 1
Investigating the Range as a Function of the Angle of Projection

how the range of a projectile depends on its angle of projection.
lets start from what is range of projection and what is angle of projection.

range of projection is the distance that a projectile has to travel before it hits the ground.
the range can be horisontal or vertical.
angle of projection is the angle of which the projectile is projected from the ground. 
in other words we have a projectile that "shoots" from a point at a certain angle.
 
 how range depends on angle
 vertical
 if the angle is small the vertical range is also small which means the projectile will return(hit) to the ground faster. 
 if the angle is big the vertical range is big which means the projectile will go far vertically before it hits the ground.
 horisontal
if the angle is small the horisontal range is big which means the projectile will go far horisontally before it hits the ground.
if the angle is big the horisontal range is small which means the projectile will return(hit) to the ground faster.

the eqations:
horisontal motion is $x=v_0cos(θ)t$
vertical motiion is $y=v_0sin(θ)t-\frac{1}{2}gt^2$
and range is $R=\frac{v_0^2sin(2θ)}{g}$
$v_0$ is the velocity, 
$θ$ is the angle of projection, 
$g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.
