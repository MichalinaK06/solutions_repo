Theoretical Foundation Projectile motion is a classic two-dimensional problem governed by Newton\u2019s laws. We\u2019re dealing with an object launched with an initial velocity \\(v_0\\) at an angle \\(\\theta\\) relative to the horizontal, under the influence of gravity \\(g\\) , and for now, we\u2019ll assume no air resistance and a flat surface (launch height \\(h = 0\\) ). Deriving the Equations of Motion The motion splits into horizontal (x) and vertical (y) components, and gravity only acts vertically. Start with the acceleration: Horizontal: \\(a_x = 0\\) (no forces in x-direction). Vertical: \\(a_y = -g\\) (gravity downward). Initial conditions: Initial velocity in x: \\(v_{0x} = v_0 \\cos\\theta\\) . Initial velocity in y: \\(v_{0y} = v_0 \\sin\\theta\\) . Initial position: \\((x_0, y_0) = (0, 0)\\) . Using kinematics ( \\(v = u + at\\) , \\(x = ut + \\frac{1}{2}at^2\\) ): Horizontal motion (constant velocity): \\(v_x = v_0 \\cos\\theta\\) . \\(x(t) = (v_0 \\cos\\theta) t\\) .

Family of Solutions The parameters \\(v_0\\) , \\(\\theta\\) , and \\(g\\) define a family of trajectories.

Theoretical Foundation Differential Equation The motion of a forced damped pendulum is governed by a second-order nonlinear differential equation. For a pendulum of length \\(L\\) , mass \\(m\\) , under gravitational acceleration \\(g\\) , with damping coefficient \\(b\\) , and an external periodic force \\(F(t) = F_0 \\cos(\\omega t)\\) , the equation is: \\[ mL\\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + b\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + mg\\sin\\theta = F_0 \\cos(\\omega t) \\] Dividing through by \\(mL\\) : \\[ \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + \\frac{b}{m}\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + \\frac{g}{L}\\sin\\theta = \\frac{F_0}{mL}\\cos(\\omega t) \\] Define: Natural frequency: \\(\\omega_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{g}{L}}\\) Damping ratio: \\(\\gamma = \\frac{b}{m}\\) (often written as \\(\\beta = \\frac{b}{2m}\\) in some contexts) Driving amplitude: \\(A = \\frac{F_0}{mL}\\) So the equation becomes: \\[ \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + \\gamma\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + \\omega_0^2 \\sin\\theta = A \\cos(\\omega t) \\] This is a nonlinear equation due to the \\(\\sin\\theta\\) term, making it rich with complex behavior. Small-Angle Approximation For small angles ( \\(\\theta \\ll 1\\) ), \\(\\sin\\theta \\approx \\theta\\) , reducing the equation to a linear form: \\[ \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + \\gamma\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + \\omega_0^2 \\theta = A \\cos(\\omega t) \\] This is the equation of a damped harmonic oscillator with a periodic driving force. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution (transient) and particular solution (steady-state): Homogeneous solution : $$ \\theta_h(t) = e^{-\\gamma t/2} \\left( C_1 \\cos(\\omega_d t) + C_2 \\sin(\\omega_d t) \\right) $$ where \\(\\omega_d = \\sqrt{\\omega_0^2 - (\\gamma/2)^2}\\) is the damped frequency (assuming underdamping, \\(\\gamma < 2\\omega_0\\) ).

The amplitude \\(D\\) peaks when \\(\\omega = \\omega_0\\) , maximizing energy transfer from the driving force to the pendulum. For small damping ( \\(\\gamma \\ll \\omega_0\\) ), the peak amplitude scales as \\(D \\propto \\frac{A}{\\gamma \\omega_0}\\) , showing that lighter damping leads to sharper resonance. This energy amplification is critical in systems like mechanical oscillators or electrical circuits. 2. Analysis of Dynamics Influence of Parameters Damping Coefficient ( \\(\\gamma\\) ) : Low \\(\\gamma\\) : Sustained oscillations with large amplitude near resonance. High \\(\\gamma\\) : Overdamping suppresses oscillations, and the system settles to the driving rhythm or equilibrium. Driving Amplitude ( \\(A\\) ) : Small \\(A\\) : Linear behavior dominates (small-angle approximation holds). Large \\(A\\) : Nonlinear effects (e.g., \\(\\sin\\theta\\) ) become significant, potentially driving the pendulum over the top ( librations to rotations) or into chaos. Driving Frequency ( \\(\\omega\\) ) : \\(\\omega \\approx \\omega_0\\) : Resonance amplifies motion. \\(\\omega \\ll \\omega_0\\) : The pendulum follows the slow driving force. \\(\\omega \\gg \\omega_0\\) : Small, rapid oscillations with reduced amplitude. Transition to Chaos For large driving amplitudes or specific frequency ratios, the nonlinear \\(\\sin\\theta\\) term triggers complex dynamics: Regular Motion : At low \\(A\\) , the pendulum oscillates periodically, possibly synchronized with the driving force (period-1 motion). Quasiperiodic Motion : Multiple incommensurate frequencies emerge, seen in Poincar\u00e9 sections as closed curves. Chaotic Motion : Sensitive dependence on initial conditions appears, with aperiodic motion and a strange attractor in phase space. This often occurs when \\(A\\) exceeds a critical threshold, dependent on \\(\\gamma\\) and \\(\\omega/\\omega_0\\) . The transition is analyzed via bifurcation diagrams, where \\(\\theta\\) or \\(d\\theta/dt\\) is plotted against \\(A\\) or \\(\\omega\\) , showing period-doubling routes to chaos. 3. Practical Applications The forced damped pendulum model applies to: Energy Harvesting : Piezoelectric devices convert mechanical vibrations (modeled as driven oscillators) into electrical energy, optimized near resonance. Suspension Bridges : External forces (wind, traffic) can drive oscillations; Tacoma Narrows\u2019 collapse (1940) is a dramatic example of resonance and nonlinearity. Oscillating Circuits : LC circuits with external AC sources mimic the pendulum\u2019s dynamics, used in signal processing. In each case, understanding resonance and chaos helps design stable or efficient systems. 4.

Gravitational Force as the Centripetal Force : A body (e.g., a planet or satellite) in a circular orbit around a central mass (e.g., a star or planet) is held in place by gravity, which provides the necessary centripetal force to maintain circular motion. The gravitational force between two masses \\(M\\) (central body) and \\(m\\) (orbiting body) is given by Newton\u2019s law of gravitation: \\[ F_g = \\frac{G M m}{r^2} \\] where \\(G\\) is the gravitational constant, and \\(r\\) is the orbital radius (distance from the center of the central mass to the orbiting body). For circular motion, the centripetal force required is: \\[ F_c = \\frac{m v^2}{r} \\] where \\(v\\) is the orbital velocity. Since gravity provides this centripetal force, we equate them: \\[ \\frac{G M m}{r^2} = \\frac{m v^2}{r} \\] 2. Simplify the Equation : Cancel \\(m\\) (assuming \\(m \\neq 0\\) , which is true for any orbiting body): \\[ \\frac{G M}{r^2} = \\frac{v^2}{r} \\] Multiply both sides by \\(r\\) : \\[ \\frac{G M}{r} = v^2 \\] Solve for \\(v\\) : \\[ v = \\sqrt{\\frac{G M}{r}} \\] 3. Relate Velocity to Orbital Period : For a circular orbit, the orbiting body travels the circumference of the orbit ( \\(2\\pi r\\) ) in one orbital period ( \\(T\\) ): \\[ v = \\frac{2\\pi r}{T} \\] Substitute this into the velocity equation: \\[ \\frac{2\\pi r}{T} = \\sqrt{\\frac{G M}{r}} \\] 4. Solve for the Period : Square both sides to eliminate the square root: \\[ \\left(\\frac{2\\pi r}{T}\\right)^2 = \\frac{G M}{r} \\] \\[ \\frac{4\\pi^2 r^2}{T^2} = \\frac{G M}{r} \\] Multiply both sides by \\(T^2\\) : \\[ 4\\pi^2 r^2 = \\frac{G M}{r} T^2 \\] Multiply both sides by \\(r\\) : \\[ 4\\pi^2 r^3 = G M T^2 \\] Rearrange: \\[ T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G M} r^3 \\] 5. Final Form : This is Kepler\u2019s Third Law for circular orbits: \\[ T^2 = k r^3 \\] where \\(k = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G M}\\) is a constant for all bodies orbiting the same central mass \\(M\\) . Thus, the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the orbital radius. Implications for Astronomy Kepler\u2019s Third Law is a powerful tool with far-reaching implications: 1. Determining Planetary Masses : If \\(T\\) and \\(r\\) are measured for a satellite or moon orbiting a planet, and \\(G\\) is known, we can solve for \\(M\\) : \\[ M = \\frac{4\\pi^2 r^3}{G T^2} \\] For example, by observing the Moon\u2019s orbit around Earth, we can calculate Earth\u2019s mass. 2. Measuring Distances : For planets orbiting the Sun, if we know \\(T\\) for one planet (e.g., Earth: 1 year, \\(r = 1\\) AU), we can use the law in ratio form to find \\(r\\) for another planet: \\[ \\frac{T_1^2}{T_2^2} = \\frac{r_1^3}{r_2^3} \\] This helped astronomers like Kepler determine relative distances in the Solar System. 3. Satellite Orbits : Engineers use this relationship to design satellite orbits. For geostationary satellites, \\(T = 24\\) hours, and solving for \\(r\\) gives an altitude of approximately 35,786 km above Earth\u2019s equator. 4.

Physically, it\u2019s the speed where the centrifugal force balances the gravitational pull, keeping the object in orbit without escaping or falling back. Second Cosmic Velocity (Escape Velocity) This is the speed required to completely escape a celestial body\u2019s gravitational influence, starting from its surface, and travel to infinity with zero residual speed. It\u2019s the threshold for breaking free\u2014no orbit, just departure into space. Third Cosmic Velocity This is the speed needed to escape the gravitational pull of a star system (e.g., the Sun) from a specific point within it, such as a planet\u2019s surface, and venture into interstellar space. It builds on the second cosmic velocity by accounting for the star\u2019s gravity over vast distances. Mathematical Derivations First Cosmic Velocity (v_1) For a circular orbit, the gravitational force provides the centripetal force: \\(F_g = F_c\\) \\[\\frac{G M m}{r^2} = \\frac{m v_1^2}{r}\\] Cancel \\(m\\) (mass of the orbiting object) and simplify: \\[v_1^2 = \\frac{G M}{r}\\] \\[v_1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{G M}{r}}\\] Where: - \\(G\\) : Gravitational constant ( \\(6.67430 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\text{m}^3 \\text{kg}^{-1} \\text{s}^{-2}\\) ) \\(M\\) : Mass of the celestial body \\(r\\) : Radius of the body (assuming orbit near the surface) Second Cosmic Velocity (v_2) Escape velocity comes from energy conservation. The total mechanical energy at the surface (kinetic + potential) equals zero at infinity (where potential energy is zero, and residual speed is zero): \\[\\frac{1}{2} m v_2^2 - \\frac{G M m}{r} = 0\\] \\[\\frac{1}{2} v_2^2 = \\frac{G M}{r}\\] \\[v_2^2 = \\frac{2 G M}{r}\\] \\[v_2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 G M}{r}}\\] Notice: \\(v_2 = v_1 \\sqrt{2}\\) , so escape velocity is \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) times the orbital velocity. Third Cosmic Velocity (v_3) This is more complex, as it involves escaping the Sun\u2019s gravity from a planet\u2019s orbit. It\u2019s the velocity needed at a planet\u2019s surface to reach the Sun\u2019s escape velocity at the planet\u2019s distance ( \\(R\\) ) from the Sun. First, the escape speed from the Sun\u2019s gravity at distance \\(R\\) : \\[v_{\\text{esc,Sun}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 G M_{\\text{Sun}}}{R}}\\] The planet orbits the Sun at speed: \\[v_{\\text{orbit}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_{\\text{Sun}}}{R}}\\] The additional speed ( \\(v_{\\infty}\\) ) needed to escape the Sun\u2019s gravity, added to the orbital speed, is: \\[v_{\\infty} = v_{\\text{esc,Sun}} - v_{\\text{orbit}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 G M_{\\text{Sun}}}{R}} - \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_{\\text{Sun}}}{R}}\\] From the planet\u2019s surface, \\(v_3\\) combines escaping the planet ( \\(v_2\\) ) and achieving \\(v_{\\infty}\\) relative to the Sun. Approximations vary, but a simplified form (assuming a hyperbolic trajectory) is: \\[v_3 \\approx \\sqrt{v_2^2 + v_{\\infty}^2}\\] Parameters Affecting Velocities Mass (M) : Higher mass increases gravitational pull, raising all velocities. Radius (r) : Larger radius decreases velocities by increasing distance from the center of mass. Distance from Star (R) : For \\(v_3\\) , a greater orbital radius reduces the Sun\u2019s influence, lowering the required speed.

For Earth, \\(7.91\\) km/s is the baseline\u2014real launches hit \\(~9\\) km/s due to atmosphere. Mars : Lower \\(v_1\\) ( \\(3.55\\) km/s) makes orbiting easier, aiding missions like Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Second Cosmic Velocity (Escaping) Planetary Missions : To send probes to Mars or beyond, we exceed Earth\u2019s \\(v_2\\) ( \\(11.19\\) km/s). Apollo missions used this to reach the Moon (not escaping Earth fully, but leveraging orbits). Jupiter : Its high \\(v_2\\) ( \\(60.2\\) km/s) makes escaping its gravity a monumental challenge\u2014hence why probes like Juno orbit rather than land and depart. Third Cosmic Velocity (Interstellar) Voyager Probes : Launched from Earth, they used gravitational assists to approach \\(v_3\\) , escaping the Sun\u2019s grasp (effective speed \\(~17\\) km/s relative to the Sun). Future Travel : Interstellar missions need \\(v_3\\) or beyond, likely requiring advanced propulsion (e.g., nuclear or solar sails). These velocities shape mission design\u2014rockets must pack enough energy (via chemical or future propulsion) to hit these thresholds, often using gravity assists to bridge gaps.

Possible Trajectories of a Payload Released Near Earth When a payload is released from a moving rocket near Earth, its trajectory depends on its initial position (relative to Earth\u2019s center) and velocity (magnitude and direction) at the moment of release. Earth\u2019s gravitational field governs the motion, and the resulting path can be classified using the specific orbital energy and angular momentum. The possible trajectories are: Elliptical Trajectory : If the payload\u2019s total mechanical energy (kinetic + potential) is negative, it follows a bound orbit, typically an ellipse with Earth at one focus (per Kepler\u2019s First Law). This occurs when the release velocity is less than the local escape velocity but sufficient to maintain a closed orbit. Example: A payload released with a tangential velocity slightly below circular orbit speed. Circular Trajectory : A special case of an elliptical orbit where the eccentricity is zero. This requires the release velocity to exactly match the circular orbit speed, \\(v_c = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{r}}\\) , where \\(G\\) is the gravitational constant, \\(M\\) is Earth\u2019s mass, and \\(r\\) is the distance from Earth\u2019s center. Parabolic Trajectory : If the total energy is exactly zero, the payload follows a parabola, escaping Earth\u2019s gravity with the minimum energy required. This happens when the release velocity equals the escape velocity, \\(v_e = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{r}}\\) . Hyperbolic Trajectory : If the total energy is positive (velocity exceeds escape velocity), the payload follows an unbound hyperbolic path, escaping Earth indefinitely. This is common in scenarios like interplanetary probes launched with excess speed. The trajectory type hinges on the specific energy : \\[\\epsilon = \\frac{v^2}{2} - \\frac{GM}{r}\\] \\(\\epsilon < 0\\) : Elliptical (bound) \\(\\epsilon = 0\\) : Parabolic (marginally unbound) \\(\\epsilon > 0\\) : Hyperbolic (unbound) 2. Numerical Analysis of the Payload\u2019s Path Let\u2019s compute the trajectory numerically with example initial conditions. Assume the payload is released from a rocket at: Altitude : \\(400\\) km (common for low Earth orbit, LEO) Distance from Earth\u2019s center : \\(r = R_e + h = 6371 \\, \\text{km} + 400 \\, \\text{km} = 6771 \\, \\text{km} = 6.771 \\times 10^6 \\, \\text{m}\\) Initial velocity : We\u2019ll test three cases to explore different trajectories. Earth\u2019s parameters : \\(GM = 3.986 \\times 10^{14} \\, \\text{m}^3/\\text{s}^2\\) , \\(R_e = 6.371 \\times 10^6 \\, \\text{m}\\) . Governing Equations The motion is governed by Newton\u2019s Law of Gravitation in vector form: \\[\\ddot{\\mathbf{r}} = -\\frac{GM}{r^3} \\mathbf{r}\\] where \\(\\mathbf{r}\\) is the position vector from Earth\u2019s center, and \\(r = |\\mathbf{r}|\\) . In 2D Cartesian coordinates ( \\(x, y\\) ), with Earth at the origin: \\[\\ddot{x} = -\\frac{GM}{r^3} x, \\quad \\ddot{y} = -\\frac{GM}{r^3} y\\] where \\(r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\\) . Initial Conditions Position : Released at \\((x_0, y_0) = (6.771 \\times 10^6, 0) \\, \\text{m}\\) (along the x-axis). Velocity Cases : Elliptical : \\(v_0 = 7.5 \\, \\text{km/s}\\) (tangential, below circular speed). Parabolic : \\(v_0 = v_e = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{r}} \\approx 11.1 \\, \\text{km/s}\\) (tangential). Hyperbolic : \\(v_0 = 12.0 \\, \\text{km/s}\\) (tangential, above escape speed). Velocity direction: \\((v_x, v_y) = (0, v_0)\\) (tangential along y-axis). Numerical Method Use a simple Euler method or a more accurate Runge-Kutta (RK4) integrator to solve these second-order ODEs. For brevity, I\u2019ll outline the Euler approach: Discretize time: \\(\\Delta t = 1 \\, \\text{s}\\) . Update rules: \\[v_x(t + \\Delta t) = v_x(t) - \\frac{GM}{r^3} x(t) \\Delta t\\] \\[x(t + \\Delta t) = x(t) + v_x(t) \\Delta t\\] (Similarly for \\(y\\) and \\(v_y\\) ). Running this for 10,000 seconds: Elliptical : The payload orbits Earth, completing an ellipse with perigee at 400 km and apogee depending on eccentricity. Parabolic : The payload moves outward, asymptotically approaching infinite distance with zero residual speed. Hyperbolic : The payload escapes rapidly, following a sharply curved path away from Earth. 3. Relation to Orbital Insertion, Reentry, and Escape Orbital Insertion : An elliptical or circular trajectory corresponds to successful orbit. For example, releasing a satellite at \\(7.5\\) km/s tangentially at \\(400\\) km altitude places it in LEO, ideal for deployment. Reentry : If the initial velocity is insufficient (e.g., suborbital, \\(< 7.5\\) km/s at \\(400\\) km), or if directed downward, the payload intersects Earth\u2019s atmosphere, leading to reentry. Atmospheric drag then dominates, slowing it for landing or burn-up. Escape : Parabolic or hyperbolic trajectories result in escape. A payload released at \\(11.1\\) km/s or higher escapes Earth\u2019s gravity, relevant for lunar missions or beyond. 4.

So: $$ \\eta_{\\text{sum}}(0, 0, 0) = 4 \\cdot \\frac{A}{\\sqrt{\\sqrt{2}d}} \\cos(k\\sqrt{2}d) $$ This is maximized when \\(k\\sqrt{2}d = 2\\pi m\\) , showing strong constructive interference if the wavelength fits the geometry. Along the x-axis ( \\(y = 0\\) ), distances vary: \\(r_1 = r_2 = \\sqrt{(x - d)^2 + d^2}\\) , \\(r_3 = r_4 = \\sqrt{(x + d)^2 + d^2}\\) . The pattern oscillates as \\(x\\) changes. The interference creates a grid-like pattern with peaks and troughs, more complex than the two-source case (which gives straight fringes).","title":"Step 5: Analyze Interference Patterns"},{"location":"1%20Physics/3%20Waves/Problem_1/#step-6-visualization","text":"Wave Interference Simulation","title":"Step 6: Visualization"},{"location":"1%20Physics/4%20Electromagnetism/Problem_1/","text":"Problem 1 sas Simulating the Effects of the Lorentz Force The Lorentz force, defined as \\( \\mathbf{F} = q(\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}) \\) , describes the force on a charged particle in the presence of electric ( \\( \\mathbf{E} \\) ) and magnetic ( \\( \\mathbf{B} \\) ) fields, where \\( q \\) is the charge and \\( \\mathbf{v} \\) is the particle's velocity. This simulation explores its applications, computes particle trajectories under different field configurations, and visualizes the results. 1. Exploration of Applications The Lorentz force is critical in several systems: - Particle Accelerators : In cyclotrons, magnetic fields cause charged particles to follow circular paths, while electric fields accelerate them. The balance of forces increases particle energy for research or medical applications. - Mass Spectrometers : Magnetic fields deflect ions based on their charge-to-mass ratio ( \\( q/m \\) ), enabling identification of chemical species. - Plasma Confinement : In fusion devices like tokamaks, magnetic fields confine charged particles in helical paths to sustain high-temperature plasmas. - Astrophysics : The Lorentz force governs solar wind interactions with Earth\u2019s magnetic field, producing auroras. The electric field ( \\( \\mathbf{E} \\) ) accelerates particles linearly, while the magnetic field ( \\( \\mathbf{B} \\) ) induces circular or helical motion perpendicular to both \\( \\mathbf{B} \\) and \\( \\mathbf{v} \\) .

Results and Visualizations Uniform Magnetic Field Trajectory : Circular motion in the XY plane. Larmor Radius : \\( r_L = \\frac{m v_\\perp}{|q| B} \\) . For \\( v_\\perp = 10^5 \\, \\text{m/s} \\) , \\( B = 1 \\, \\text{T} \\) , \\( r_L \\approx 0.001 \\, \\text{m} \\) , matching the plot. Relevance : Seen in cyclotrons where particles spiral with constant radius. Combined Electric and Magnetic Fields Trajectory : Helical path with drift along the X-axis. Drift Velocity : \\( v_d = \\frac{E \\times B}{B^2} \\) . For \\( E_x = 10^5 \\, \\text{N/C} \\) , \\( B_z = 1 \\, \\text{T} \\) , \\( v_d \\approx 10^5 \\, \\text{m/s} \\) , consistent with the simulation. Relevance : Magnetic traps use this to confine particles with drift. Crossed Fields Trajectory : Helical motion with pronounced \\( \\mathbf{E} \\times \\mathbf{B} \\) drift. Application : Used in velocity selectors, where particles with \\( v = E/B \\) pass undeflected. Parameter Variation Stronger \\( B \\) (2 T) : Smaller Larmor radius ( \\( r_L \\propto 1/B \\) ), tightening the spiral. 5. Discussion The simulations illustrate how the Lorentz force shapes particle motion: - In cyclotrons, uniform \\( B \\) fields produce circular orbits, with radius controlled by \\( B \\) and \\( v \\) . - In plasma confinement, combined fields create helical paths with drifts, stabilizing charged particles. - Crossed fields enable precise control, as in mass spectrometers or magnetrons. These results align with real-world systems, offering an intuitive grasp of the Lorentz force\u2019s role in technology and nature. Notes The Euler method is simple but less accurate for long simulations; Runge-Kutta (e.g., RK4) could improve precision. Units are in SI for consistency (meters, seconds, tesla, etc.). Visualizations are 3D, but 2D plots can highlight specific planes (e.g., XY for circular motion). This simulation provides a foundation for exploring more complex scenarios, such as non-uniform fields or relativistic effects.","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/4%20Electromagnetism/Problem_1/#problem-1","text":"sas","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/4%20Electromagnetism/Problem_1/#simulating-the-effects-of-the-lorentz-force","text":"The Lorentz force, defined as \\( \\mathbf{F} = q(\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}) \\) , describes the force on a charged particle in the presence of electric ( \\( \\mathbf{E} \\) ) and magnetic ( \\( \\mathbf{B} \\) ) fields, where \\( q \\) is the charge and \\( \\mathbf{v} \\) is the particle's velocity.
