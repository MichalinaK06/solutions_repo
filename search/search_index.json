How the range of a projectile depends on its angle of projection. Let's start from, what is range of projection? and what is angle of projection? Range of projection is the distance that a projectile has to travel before it hits the ground. The range can be horisontal or vertical. Angle of projection is the angle of which the projectile is projected from the ground. In other words we have a projectile that \"shoots\" from a point at a certain angle. How range depends on angle Vertical If the angle is small the vertical range is also small which means the projectile will hit the ground faster. If the angle is big the vertical range is big which means the projectile will go far vertically before it hits the ground. Horisontal If the angle is small the horisontal range is big which means the projectile will go far horisontally before it hits the ground. If the angle is big the horisontal range is small which means the projectile will return(hit) to the ground faster. It's proboably hard to imagine this in your head so Angle to range in geogebra Math The eqations in the Range of a projectile: Most useful equation is range: \\[R=\\frac{v_0^2sin(2\u03b8)}{g}\\] In which: \\(R\\) is the range \\(v_0\\) is the velocity \\(\u03b8\\) is the angle of projection \\(g\\) which is \\(9.81\\) is the acceleration due to gravity Other useful equations are: horisontal motion: \\(x=v_0cos(\u03b8)t\\) vertical motiion: \\(y=v_0sin(\u03b8)t-\\frac{1}{2}gt^2\\) distance(range) of projectile if its launched from a height: \\(R=\\frac{v_0 \\cdot cos(\u03b8)}{g}(v_0 \\cdot sin(\u03b8) + \\sqrt{v_0^2 \\cdot sin^2(\u03b8)+2gy_0})\\) in which: \\(v_0\\) is velocity \\(t\\) is time of flight \\(g\\) is acceleration due to gravity \\(y_0\\) is hight of launch of the projectile Maximum range It is known that \\(\u03b8=45\u00b0\\) gives maximum range, let's prove this. We can prove it with trigonometry and caclculus. Trigonometry sin's function ( \\(sin(2\u03b8)\\) ) is maximum when the angle is 90\u00b0 and from the equation of range \\(R=\\frac{v_0^2sin(2\u03b8)}{g}\\) we can see that max angle is \\(sin(2\u03b8)=90\u00b0\\) \\(2\u03b8=90\u00b0\\) \\(\u03b8=45\u00b0\\) Calculus This can also be proven with calculus, from the formula \\(R=\\frac{v_0^2sin(2\u03b8)}{g}\\) We want to maximize the range(R) so we need to find the maximum of the function How to find the maximum of the function: We need to find the derivative of the function and set it to \\(0\\) We specifficaly want to find the derivative with respect to \\(\u03b8\\) So after differnciating R with respect to \\(\u03b8\\) we get \\(\\frac{dR}{d\u03b8}=\\frac{2v_0^2}{g}cos(2\u03b8)\\) now we need to set it to 0 \\(\\frac{2v_0^2}{g}cos(2\u03b8)=0\\) we know that \\(v_0^2\\) and \\(g\\) are constants so we can ignore them \\(cos(2\u03b8)=0\\) maximum angle of \\(\u03b8\\) is \\(90\u00b0\\) so \\(2\u03b8=90\\) \\(\u03b8=45\\) this proves that \\(45\u00b0\\) gives the maximum range using calculus.","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#problem-1","text":"","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#investigating-the-range-as-a-function-of-the-angle-of-projection","text":"How the range of a projectile depends on its angle of projection.
