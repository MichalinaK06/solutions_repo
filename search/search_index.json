Theoretical Foundation Projectile motion is a classic two-dimensional problem governed by Newton\u2019s laws. We\u2019re dealing with an object launched with an initial velocity \\(v_0\\) at an angle \\(\\theta\\) relative to the horizontal, under the influence of gravity \\(g\\) , and for now, we\u2019ll assume no air resistance and a flat surface (launch height \\(h = 0\\) ). Deriving the Equations of Motion The motion splits into horizontal (x) and vertical (y) components, and gravity only acts vertically. Start with the acceleration: Horizontal: \\(a_x = 0\\) (no forces in x-direction). Vertical: \\(a_y = -g\\) (gravity downward). Initial conditions: Initial velocity in x: \\(v_{0x} = v_0 \\cos\\theta\\) . Initial velocity in y: \\(v_{0y} = v_0 \\sin\\theta\\) . Initial position: \\((x_0, y_0) = (0, 0)\\) . Using kinematics ( \\(v = u + at\\) , \\(x = ut + \\frac{1}{2}at^2\\) ): Horizontal motion (constant velocity): \\(v_x = v_0 \\cos\\theta\\) . \\(x(t) = (v_0 \\cos\\theta) t\\) .

Family of Solutions The parameters \\(v_0\\) , \\(\\theta\\) , and \\(g\\) define a family of trajectories. Changing \\(v_0\\) scales the size of the parabola, \\(\\theta\\) adjusts its shape and orientation, and \\(g\\) (e.g., Earth vs. Moon) alters the curvature. Launch height \\(h\\) or air resistance would add complexity, but we\u2019ll keep it simple for now. 2. Analysis of the Range The range \\(R\\) is the horizontal distance traveled when \\(y = 0\\) . Plug \\[t = T = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin\\theta}{g}\\] into the x-equation: \\[ R = (v_0 \\cos\\theta) \\cdot \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin\\theta}{g} \\] Use the identity \\(\\sin 2\\theta = 2 \\sin\\theta \\cos\\theta\\) : \\[R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin 2\\theta}{g}\\] Dependence on Angle \\(\\theta\\) Maximum Range : \\(R\\) peaks when \\(\\sin 2\\theta = 1\\) , so \\(2\\theta = 90^\\circ\\) , or \\(\\theta = 45^\\circ\\) .

Theoretical Foundation Differential Equation The motion of a forced damped pendulum is governed by a second-order nonlinear differential equation. For a pendulum of length \\(L\\) , mass \\(m\\) , under gravitational acceleration \\(g\\) , with damping coefficient \\(b\\) , and an external periodic force \\(F(t) = F_0 \\cos(\\omega t)\\) , the equation is: \\[ mL\\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + b\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + mg\\sin\\theta = F_0 \\cos(\\omega t) \\] Dividing through by \\(mL\\) : \\[ \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + \\frac{b}{m}\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + \\frac{g}{L}\\sin\\theta = \\frac{F_0}{mL}\\cos(\\omega t) \\] Define: Natural frequency: \\(\\omega_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{g}{L}}\\) Damping ratio: \\(\\gamma = \\frac{b}{m}\\) (often written as \\(\\beta = \\frac{b}{2m}\\) in some contexts) Driving amplitude: \\(A = \\frac{F_0}{mL}\\) So the equation becomes: \\[ \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + \\gamma\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + \\omega_0^2 \\sin\\theta = A \\cos(\\omega t) \\] This is a nonlinear equation due to the \\(\\sin\\theta\\) term, making it rich with complex behavior. Small-Angle Approximation For small angles ( \\(\\theta \\ll 1\\) ), \\(\\sin\\theta \\approx \\theta\\) , reducing the equation to a linear form: \\[ \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + \\gamma\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + \\omega_0^2 \\theta = A \\cos(\\omega t) \\] This is the equation of a damped harmonic oscillator with a periodic driving force. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution (transient) and particular solution (steady-state): Homogeneous solution : $$ \\theta_h(t) = e^{-\\gamma t/2} \\left( C_1 \\cos(\\omega_d t) + C_2 \\sin(\\omega_d t) \\right) $$ where \\(\\omega_d = \\sqrt{\\omega_0^2 - (\\gamma/2)^2}\\) is the damped frequency (assuming underdamping, \\(\\gamma < 2\\omega_0\\) ).

The amplitude \\(D\\) peaks when \\(\\omega = \\omega_0\\) , maximizing energy transfer from the driving force to the pendulum. For small damping ( \\(\\gamma \\ll \\omega_0\\) ), the peak amplitude scales as \\(D \\propto \\frac{A}{\\gamma \\omega_0}\\) , showing that lighter damping leads to sharper resonance. This energy amplification is critical in systems like mechanical oscillators or electrical circuits. 2. Analysis of Dynamics Influence of Parameters Damping Coefficient ( \\(\\gamma\\) ) : Low \\(\\gamma\\) : Sustained oscillations with large amplitude near resonance. High \\(\\gamma\\) : Overdamping suppresses oscillations, and the system settles to the driving rhythm or equilibrium. Driving Amplitude ( \\(A\\) ) : Small \\(A\\) : Linear behavior dominates (small-angle approximation holds). Large \\(A\\) : Nonlinear effects (e.g., \\(\\sin\\theta\\) ) become significant, potentially driving the pendulum over the top ( librations to rotations) or into chaos. Driving Frequency ( \\(\\omega\\) ) : \\(\\omega \\approx \\omega_0\\) : Resonance amplifies motion. \\(\\omega \\ll \\omega_0\\) : The pendulum follows the slow driving force. \\(\\omega \\gg \\omega_0\\) : Small, rapid oscillations with reduced amplitude. Transition to Chaos For large driving amplitudes or specific frequency ratios, the nonlinear \\(\\sin\\theta\\) term triggers complex dynamics: Regular Motion : At low \\(A\\) , the pendulum oscillates periodically, possibly synchronized with the driving force (period-1 motion). Quasiperiodic Motion : Multiple incommensurate frequencies emerge, seen in Poincar\u00e9 sections as closed curves. Chaotic Motion : Sensitive dependence on initial conditions appears, with aperiodic motion and a strange attractor in phase space. This often occurs when \\(A\\) exceeds a critical threshold, dependent on \\(\\gamma\\) and \\(\\omega/\\omega_0\\) . The transition is analyzed via bifurcation diagrams, where \\(\\theta\\) or \\(d\\theta/dt\\) is plotted against \\(A\\) or \\(\\omega\\) , showing period-doubling routes to chaos. 3. Practical Applications The forced damped pendulum model applies to: Energy Harvesting : Piezoelectric devices convert mechanical vibrations (modeled as driven oscillators) into electrical energy, optimized near resonance. Suspension Bridges : External forces (wind, traffic) can drive oscillations; Tacoma Narrows\u2019 collapse (1940) is a dramatic example of resonance and nonlinearity. Oscillating Circuits : LC circuits with external AC sources mimic the pendulum\u2019s dynamics, used in signal processing. In each case, understanding resonance and chaos helps design stable or efficient systems. 4.

Implementation"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_1/","text":"Problem 1 Derivation of Kepler\u2019s Third Law for Circular Orbits To derive the relationship between the square of the orbital period ( \\(T^2\\) ) and the cube of the orbital radius ( \\(r^3\\) ) for a body in a circular orbit, we start with the physics of circular motion and gravity. How it works: 1. Gravitational Force as the Centripetal Force : A body (e.g., a planet or satellite) in a circular orbit around a central mass (e.g., a star or planet) is held in place by gravity, which provides the necessary centripetal force to maintain circular motion. The gravitational force between two masses \\(M\\) (central body) and \\(m\\) (orbiting body) is given by Newton\u2019s law of gravitation: \\[ F_g = \\frac{G M m}{r^2} \\] where \\(G\\) is the gravitational constant, and \\(r\\) is the orbital radius (distance from the center of the central mass to the orbiting body). For circular motion, the centripetal force required is: \\[ F_c = \\frac{m v^2}{r} \\] where \\(v\\) is the orbital velocity. Since gravity provides this centripetal force, we equate them: \\[ \\frac{G M m}{r^2} = \\frac{m v^2}{r} \\] 2. Simplify the Equation : Cancel \\(m\\) (assuming \\(m \\neq 0\\) , which is true for any orbiting body): \\[ \\frac{G M}{r^2} = \\frac{v^2}{r} \\] Multiply both sides by \\(r\\) : \\[ \\frac{G M}{r} = v^2 \\] Solve for \\(v\\) : \\[ v = \\sqrt{\\frac{G M}{r}} \\] 3. Relate Velocity to Orbital Period : For a circular orbit, the orbiting body travels the circumference of the orbit ( \\(2\\pi r\\) ) in one orbital period ( \\(T\\) ): \\[ v = \\frac{2\\pi r}{T} \\] Substitute this into the velocity equation: \\[ \\frac{2\\pi r}{T} = \\sqrt{\\frac{G M}{r}} \\] 4. Solve for the Period : Square both sides to eliminate the square root: \\[ \\left(\\frac{2\\pi r}{T}\\right)^2 = \\frac{G M}{r} \\] \\[ \\frac{4\\pi^2 r^2}{T^2} = \\frac{G M}{r} \\] Multiply both sides by \\(T^2\\) : \\[ 4\\pi^2 r^2 = \\frac{G M}{r} T^2 \\] Multiply both sides by \\(r\\) : \\[ 4\\pi^2 r^3 = G M T^2 \\] Rearrange: \\[ T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G M} r^3 \\] 5. Final Form : This is Kepler\u2019s Third Law for circular orbits: \\[ T^2 = k r^3 \\] where \\(k = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G M}\\) is a constant for all bodies orbiting the same central mass \\(M\\) . Thus, the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the orbital radius. Implications for Astronomy Kepler\u2019s Third Law is a powerful tool with far-reaching implications: 1. Determining Planetary Masses : If \\(T\\) and \\(r\\) are measured for a satellite or moon orbiting a planet, and \\(G\\) is known, we can solve for \\(M\\) : \\[ M = \\frac{4\\pi^2 r^3}{G T^2} \\] For example, by observing the Moon\u2019s orbit around Earth, we can calculate Earth\u2019s mass. 2. Measuring Distances : For planets orbiting the Sun, if we know \\(T\\) for one planet (e.g., Earth: 1 year, \\(r = 1\\) AU), we can use the law in ratio form to find \\(r\\) for another planet: \\[ \\frac{T_1^2}{T_2^2} = \\frac{r_1^3}{r_2^3} \\] This helped astronomers like Kepler determine relative distances in the Solar System. 3. Satellite Orbits : Engineers use this relationship to design satellite orbits. For geostationary satellites, \\(T = 24\\) hours, and solving for \\(r\\) gives an altitude of approximately 35,786 km above Earth\u2019s equator. 4.

Physically, it\u2019s the speed where the centrifugal force balances the gravitational pull, keeping the object in orbit without escaping or falling back. Second Cosmic Velocity (Escape Velocity) This is the speed required to completely escape a celestial body\u2019s gravitational influence, starting from its surface, and travel to infinity with zero residual speed. It\u2019s the threshold for breaking free\u2014no orbit, just departure into space. Third Cosmic Velocity This is the speed needed to escape the gravitational pull of a star system (e.g., the Sun) from a specific point within it, such as a planet\u2019s surface, and venture into interstellar space. It builds on the second cosmic velocity by accounting for the star\u2019s gravity over vast distances. Mathematical Derivations First Cosmic Velocity (v_1) For a circular orbit, the gravitational force provides the centripetal force: \\(F_g = F_c\\) \\[\\frac{G M m}{r^2} = \\frac{m v_1^2}{r}\\] Cancel \\(m\\) (mass of the orbiting object) and simplify: \\[v_1^2 = \\frac{G M}{r}\\] \\[v_1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{G M}{r}}\\] Where: - \\(G\\) : Gravitational constant ( \\(6.67430 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\text{m}^3 \\text{kg}^{-1} \\text{s}^{-2}\\) ) \\(M\\) : Mass of the celestial body \\(r\\) : Radius of the body (assuming orbit near the surface) Second Cosmic Velocity (v_2) Escape velocity comes from energy conservation. The total mechanical energy at the surface (kinetic + potential) equals zero at infinity (where potential energy is zero, and residual speed is zero): \\[\\frac{1}{2} m v_2^2 - \\frac{G M m}{r} = 0\\] \\[\\frac{1}{2} v_2^2 = \\frac{G M}{r}\\] \\[v_2^2 = \\frac{2 G M}{r}\\] \\[v_2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 G M}{r}}\\] Notice: \\(v_2 = v_1 \\sqrt{2}\\) , so escape velocity is \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) times the orbital velocity. Third Cosmic Velocity (v_3) This is more complex, as it involves escaping the Sun\u2019s gravity from a planet\u2019s orbit. It\u2019s the velocity needed at a planet\u2019s surface to reach the Sun\u2019s escape velocity at the planet\u2019s distance ( \\(R\\) ) from the Sun. First, the escape speed from the Sun\u2019s gravity at distance \\(R\\) : \\[v_{\\text{esc,Sun}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 G M_{\\text{Sun}}}{R}}\\] The planet orbits the Sun at speed: \\[v_{\\text{orbit}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_{\\text{Sun}}}{R}}\\] The additional speed ( \\(v_{\\infty}\\) ) needed to escape the Sun\u2019s gravity, added to the orbital speed, is: \\[v_{\\infty} = v_{\\text{esc,Sun}} - v_{\\text{orbit}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 G M_{\\text{Sun}}}{R}} - \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_{\\text{Sun}}}{R}}\\] From the planet\u2019s surface, \\(v_3\\) combines escaping the planet ( \\(v_2\\) ) and achieving \\(v_{\\infty}\\) relative to the Sun. Approximations vary, but a simplified form (assuming a hyperbolic trajectory) is: \\[v_3 \\approx \\sqrt{v_2^2 + v_{\\infty}^2}\\] Parameters Affecting Velocities Mass (M) : Higher mass increases gravitational pull, raising all velocities. Radius (r) : Larger radius decreases velocities by increasing distance from the center of mass.

Possible Trajectories of a Payload Released Near Earth When a payload is released from a moving rocket near Earth, its trajectory depends on its initial position (relative to Earth\u2019s center) and velocity (magnitude and direction) at the moment of release. Earth\u2019s gravitational field governs the motion, and the resulting path can be classified using the specific orbital energy and angular momentum. The possible trajectories are: Elliptical Trajectory : If the payload\u2019s total mechanical energy (kinetic + potential) is negative, it follows a bound orbit, typically an ellipse with Earth at one focus (per Kepler\u2019s First Law). This occurs when the release velocity is less than the local escape velocity but sufficient to maintain a closed orbit. Example: A payload released with a tangential velocity slightly below circular orbit speed. Circular Trajectory : A special case of an elliptical orbit where the eccentricity is zero. This requires the release velocity to exactly match the circular orbit speed, \\(v_c = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{r}}\\) , where \\(G\\) is the gravitational constant, \\(M\\) is Earth\u2019s mass, and \\(r\\) is the distance from Earth\u2019s center. Parabolic Trajectory : If the total energy is exactly zero, the payload follows a parabola, escaping Earth\u2019s gravity with the minimum energy required. This happens when the release velocity equals the escape velocity, \\(v_e = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{r}}\\) . Hyperbolic Trajectory : If the total energy is positive (velocity exceeds escape velocity), the payload follows an unbound hyperbolic path, escaping Earth indefinitely. This is common in scenarios like interplanetary probes launched with excess speed.

Reentry : If the initial velocity is insufficient (e.g., suborbital, \\(< 7.5\\) km/s at \\(400\\) km), or if directed downward, the payload intersects Earth\u2019s atmosphere, leading to reentry. Atmospheric drag then dominates, slowing it for landing or burn-up. Escape : Parabolic or hyperbolic trajectories result in escape.

Earth\u2019s gravitational field governs the motion, and the resulting path can be classified using the specific orbital energy and angular momentum. The possible trajectories are: Elliptical Trajectory : If the payload\u2019s total mechanical energy (kinetic + potential) is negative, it follows a bound orbit, typically an ellipse with Earth at one focus (per Kepler\u2019s First Law). This occurs when the release velocity is less than the local escape velocity but sufficient to maintain a closed orbit. Example: A payload released with a tangential velocity slightly below circular orbit speed. Circular Trajectory : A special case of an elliptical orbit where the eccentricity is zero. This requires the release velocity to exactly match the circular orbit speed, \\(v_c = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{r}}\\) , where \\(G\\) is the gravitational constant, \\(M\\) is Earth\u2019s mass, and \\(r\\) is the distance from Earth\u2019s center.

Traditional methods like series-parallel reduction can become tedious for complex networks. Graph theory provides a systematic approach by modeling circuits as graphs\u2014nodes represent junctions, and edges represent resistors with weights as resistance values. This document presents a Python implementation to compute equivalent resistance iteratively, leveraging graph simplification techniques. Algorithm Description: Calculating Equivalent Resistance Using Graph Theory The goal is to calculate the equivalent resistance of a circuit by modeling it as an undirected weighted graph. In this graph: Nodes represent junctions or connection points in the circuit. Edges represent resistors, with weights equal to their resistance values (in ohms). The equivalent resistance is computed between two specified nodes (e.g., the input and output terminals). The algorithm iteratively simplifies the graph by identifying and reducing series and parallel resistor configurations until only two nodes remain, connected by a single edge representing the equivalent resistance. Here\u2019s how it works: Key Steps: Model the Circuit as a Graph : Input: A graph with nodes (junctions) and weighted edges (resistors), plus two terminal nodes (start and end). Example: A series circuit with two resistors (R1 = 2\u03a9, R2 = 3\u03a9) becomes a graph with three nodes (A \u2192 B \u2192 C) and edges A-B (2\u03a9) and B-C (3\u03a9). Identify Series Connections : A node with exactly two neighbors (degree 2) indicates a series connection. Replace the two edges (e.g., A-B with R1, B-C with R2) with a single edge (A-C) whose weight is R1 + R2. Remove the intermediate node (B). Identify Parallel Connections : Two nodes connected by multiple edges (or a cycle of length 2) indicate parallel resistors. Replace parallel edges (e.g., R1 and R2 between A and B) with a single edge whose weight is given by the parallel resistance formula: \\(R_{eq} = \\frac{R1 \\cdot R2}{R1 + R2}\\) (or equivalently, \\(\\frac{1}{R_{eq}} = \\frac{1}{R1} + \\frac{1}{R2}\\) ). Iterate Until Simplified : Repeatedly apply series and parallel reductions until the graph has only two nodes (the terminals) and one edge. The weight of this final edge is the equivalent resistance. Handle Nested Configurations : For complex graphs (e.g., nested series-parallel or cycles), use traversal techniques (like DFS) to detect reducible substructures. Prioritize series reductions when possible, then check for parallel edges. Pseudocode: Function CalculateEquivalentResistance(Graph G, Node start, Node end): Input: Graph G (nodes, edges with weights), start node, end node Output: Equivalent resistance between start and end While G has more than 2 nodes OR more than 1 edge between start and end: // Step 1: Check for series reductions For each node N in G: If degree(N) == 2 AND N is not start or end: Let neighbors of N be A and B Let R1 = weight(A, N), R2 = weight(N, B) Remove node N and edges A-N, N-B Add edge A-B with weight = R1 + R2 // Step 2: Check for parallel reductions For each pair of nodes (A, B) in G: If multiple edges exist between A and B: Let R_values = list of weights of edges between A and B R_eq = 1 / (sum(1/R for R in R_values)) // Parallel formula Remove all edges between A and B Add single edge A-B with weight = R_eq // Final check If G has exactly 2 nodes (start, end) and 1 edge: Return weight of edge between start and end Else: Error \"Graph could not be fully reduced\" End Function Explanation of Handling Nested Combinations: Series Detection : Nodes with degree 2 are straightforward to spot and reduce. This works even in nested structures because the algorithm processes one reduction at a time. Parallel Detection : Checking for multiple edges between nodes captures parallel resistors, even if they appear after a series reduction simplifies part of the graph. Nested Cases : The iterative nature ensures that as outer layers of the circuit are simplified, inner nested structures become reducible. Example Applications Example 1: Simple Series Combination Circuit : Two resistors in series, 2\u03a9 and 3\u03a9, between nodes A and C via B. Graph : A \u2192 B (2\u03a9), B \u2192 C (3\u03a9). Reduction : Node B has degree 2. Replace A-B (2\u03a9) and B-C (3\u03a9) with A-C (2 + 3 = 5\u03a9). Graph becomes A \u2192 C (5\u03a9). Result : Equivalent resistance = 5\u03a9. Example 2: Simple Parallel Combination Circuit : Two resistors in parallel, 4\u03a9 and 6\u03a9, between nodes A and B. Graph : A \u2192 B (4\u03a9), A \u2192 B (6\u03a9) (two edges). Reduction : Parallel edges detected. Compute \\(R_{eq} = \\frac{4 \\cdot 6}{4 + 6} = \\frac{24}{10} = 2.4\u03a9\\) . Replace both edges with A-B (2.4\u03a9). Result : Equivalent resistance = 2.4\u03a9. Example 3: Nested Configuration Circuit : Two resistors in series (2\u03a9, 3\u03a9), with a parallel resistor (6\u03a9) across the pair. Graph : A \u2192 B (2\u03a9), B \u2192 C (3\u03a9) [series part]. A \u2192 C (6\u03a9) [parallel across A-C]. Reduction : Reduce series A-B (2\u03a9) and B-C (3\u03a9): Remove B, add A-C (2 + 3 = 5\u03a9). Graph now has A \u2192 C (5\u03a9) and A \u2192 C (6\u03a9) [two edges in parallel].
