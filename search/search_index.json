Angle to range in geogebra from this we can confirm that if \\(v_0<\u03b8\\) than the range is smaller than if \\(v_0>\u03b8\\) . 45 gives max range, lets prove this we can prove it with trugonometry and caclculus trigonometry sin's function is maximum when the angle is 90\u00b0 and from the equation of range \\(R=\\frac{v_0^2sin(2\u03b8)}{g}\\) we can see that max angle is \\(sin(2\u03b8)=90\\) \\(2\u03b8=90\\) \\(\u03b8=45\\) this can also be proven with calculus, from the formula \\(R=\\frac{v_0^2sin(2\u03b8)}{g}\\) we want to maximize the range(R) so we need to find the maximum of the function how to find the maximum of the function: we need to find the derivative of the function and set it to 0 we specifficaly want to find the derivative of \\(\u03b8\\) so after differnciating R with respect to \\(\u03b8\\) we get \\(\\frac{dR}{d\u03b8}=\\frac{2v_0^2}{g}cos(2\u03b8)\\) now we need to set it to 0 \\(\\frac{2v_0^2}{g}cos(2\u03b8)=0\\) we know that \\(v_0^2\\) and \\(g\\) are constants so we can ignore them \\(cos(2\u03b8)=0\\) maximum angle of \\(\u03b8\\) is \\(90\u00b0\\) so \\(2\u03b8=90\\) \\(\u03b8=45\\) this proves that 45\u00b0 gives the maximum range using calculus. how increasing velocity increases range from the equation of range we see that range is proportional to the square of the velocity How increasing velocity increases range.
